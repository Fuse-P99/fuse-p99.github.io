# Fuse Guild Constitution

## Guild Vision
We are forming <Fuse> to bring together players who share a love for classic EverQuest and the spirit of adventure. At our core, we believe in fun with friends—fostering a friendly, supportive atmosphere where camaraderie and teamwork come first.

Our primary focus is enjoying the best classic EverQuest encounters on Project 1999, from the thrill of high-end raiding to the satisfaction of small-group adventures. We aim to be a capable, well-organized raid force while maintaining a balanced and enjoyable experience for all members through strategic scheduling and shared leadership.

Beyond gameplay, <Fuse> is committed to being a positive presence on the server—fair and friendly competitors who uphold the values of integrity, cooperation, and sportsmanship. We respect both our guildmates and the broader community, striving to make EverQuest a welcoming and exciting world for all who play.

## The Golden Rule
Your actions reflect on every other guildmate. Treat your fellow members and the Fuse tag with respect. Don't be a jerk. Your conduct should always align with our guild vision and rules—if it doesn't, stop.

## Code of Conduct

1. **Compliance with Server Rules**
   - All members must adhere to Project 1999 server rules and the Play Nice Policy to the best of their knowledge and ability.

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - If a dispute arises with another player or guild, attempt to resolve it amicably.
   - If an agreement cannot be reached, seek guidance from an officer.

3. **Raid Preparedness & Participation**
   - Members should maintain raid readiness, including acquiring necessary clickies and consumables.
   - Bring your best character to the situation whenever possible to support guild success.

4. **No Farm Crews**
   - Organized groups that target raid mobs primarily for platinum gain are not in line with our guild values.
   - Prioritize inclusivity—our guild community exists for shared progress.
   - Be mindful that certain minor raid targets are major epic bottlenecks. We do not want a reputation as a guild that prioritizes platinum over community and fairness.

5. **Communication & Conduct**
   - Use good judgment in guild chat, Discord, and voice channels. Our community should remain respectful and welcoming.
   - Offensive or discriminatory comments regarding gender, race, religion, nationality, age, disability, sexual orientation, or play style will not be tolerated.
   - Keep discussions free of religion, politics, and solicitations. These topics can be divisive or disruptive.

6. **Privacy & Streaming**
   - If streaming publicly, hide guild chat to protect internal discussions and strategies.
   - For recorded videos, be mindful of guild privacy before sharing publicly.

7. **Disciplinary Action (Rules)**
   - Violations of this Code of Conduct will result in disciplinary action as determined by guild leadership.
   - First Offense: Official Warning
   - Second Offense: Seven day raid suspension.
   - Further offenses: guild removal.
   - Officers may take immediate action in severe cases. Appeals may be directed to the guild leader.

7.5 **Disciplinary Action (Raid Expectations)**
   - If you do not perform your raid role or are clearly AFK, you may not receive DKP credit for that raid. You will be notified if you are removed from the raid DKP and you will not be eligible to bid for loot on that encounter.
   - If you establish a pattern of behavior, you may receive an official warning for violating our guild's rules.

8. **Loot**
   - Celebrate the successes of your guildmates. Public disputes over loot are unacceptable.
   - If you have concerns regarding loot distribution, discuss them privately with an officer rather than causing disruptions.
   - You may not sell no-drop items (loot rights or multi-quest - ie. you may not bid for and win a vindi bp and sell the right to loot it to another player, nor may you bid for a platinum tear to mq to another player)
   - For epic items (Slime Blood, White & Green Dragon Scales, Shattered Emerald, Eye of Innoruuk, etc.) you must have a level 46+ toon that can use it. You cannot bid on these items to sell them.
   - You may not sell this list of high-end velious tradeables:
     - Helmet of Rallos Zek
     - Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings
     - Boots of the Storm
     - Earring of the Frozen Skull
     - Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask
     - White Dragon Helm
     - Mithril Boots
   - Spells that are generally worth more than 500p are not to be sold in EC. Players may bid for spells worth more than 500p during a DKP event. If no bids are received, the spell will go to the guild bank to be either given to guild bots or sold for guild funds. Spells worth less than 500p are FFA.
   - Need for spells is defined as the player bidding for a character of appropriate level and class to immediately scribe the spell and does not already own the spell or have it scribed.
