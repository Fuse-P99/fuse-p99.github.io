# DKP

* You can check your DKP using Garanel Rucksif. Send him a private message "$who" and it will display your characters, current DKP, attendance, and recent items. If you'd like to see an exhaustive list of purchased items or pending raids, you can use "$who info."
* Your Discord handle is your "main" with all your characters attached. If you change your Discord handle for whatever reason, please post it into #other-corrections channel on Fuse DKP server.
  * Note: the Fuse DKP Server is not the same as our main Discord server.
* To add a new character to your dkp account, you can post "$char-add XXXXXXXX" (e. g. "$char-add Aithne" into #ask-garanel channel on Fuse DKP server.
* DKP management is handled by Arthion. Please direct questions to him.

## Earning DKP

### How to take DKP Logs
* DKP logs should be taken when a mob is being engaged by the raid force (ideally between 0% and 30% of the target's health).
* For encounters that take a considerable amount of time, hourly logs will be taken at a specific interval (e. g. every hour at the same minute).
* Logs should be posted in the appropriate Discord channel as soon as possible after the raid target has been eliminated.

### Valid reasons for adding yourself to a DKP log
You are allowed to add yourself to raid logs when:
* You are on the encounter log but are not on the attendance log (e. g. you died).
* You were performing raid duties outside of the encounter, e. g. handling loot, looting an item from a previous target, being on COTH mage or wizard at the previous encounter to help people loot.
* You were porting people during a cluster of mobs spawning.
* You were tracking another target (unless trackers were called in, confirm this with raid leaders).
* You were holding idol camp (unless trackers were called in, confirm this with raid leaders)

### How to add yourself to DKP Logs
To add yourself to a raid when you have missed the log (see valid reasons below), please use one of the following templates:

```
+ Character_name (reason)
+ Character_name on botname
```

Examples:
```
+ Arthion (handling loot in VP from previous kill)
+ Derils (tracking ToV)
+ Aithne on Spasepope
```

Always post a reason when adding yourself to DKP logs! If no reason is posted, you will be removed without notice. If the reason is somewhat fuzzy, an officer may contact you (either via PM or via a mention in the channel) and let you know that your entry has been removed. If you believe you are eligible to earn DKP for that specific kill, please contact the officer who removed your entry via PM to discuss.

Ideally, log changes should be made within 24 hours after logs were posted. Final processing of raid logs will typically be performed within 72 hours of the raid.

### Invalid reasons for adding yourself to a DKP log
You should remove yourself to raid logs when:
* You were too late to the raid to provide any tangible value. When in doubt: ask yourself, was I too late to this raid to be useful? If the answer is yes, do not add yourself to the log.
* All the bots were taken. Bots are a privilege, not a right, we don't have an infinite number of bots, so you shouldn't rely on bot availability at any given raid. If you do, it is at your own risk.
* You didn't complete the encounter. Not all encounters end when the raid mob is dead–for example, Derakor the Vindicator's two guards (temple guardians) come into camp after he's been slain. You need to stick around until TGs are dead to be eligible for DKP.

### How to remove yourself from DKP Logs
Sometimes it is appropriate to remove yourself from a raid log–reasons for this might include: being late to the raid but making it onto logs anyway, if you were AFK for the majority of the encounter (exception: screen share). Generally, these policies are self-policed by members of the guild. If you see someone abusing raid log additions, please report it to an officer. Issues will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

To remove yourself from logs please use the following template:
```
- Character_name (Reason)
```

Example:
```
- Screapy (zoned in when AoW was at 6%)
```

### Additional remarks on preparking / fast-engage targets
* On fast-engage targets (Fear golems & draco, Trakanon, ST golems as examples), you must be pre-parked–if you are not parked, you are not eligible for DKP on that encounter.

### Changing DKP log entries
* If any member believes there is a mistake in an encounter log (e. g. wrongly entered, logs totally off, etc.) please send a direct message to an officer. Do not correct it by yourself!
* Only officers are allowed to remove players from an encounter log, if you have a concern, message an officer and they will review the issue.
* If there are issues, the offending party should remove themselves from the log. If no agreement can be reached, officers will make a collective decision about log removal.

### Repeatedly / intentionally entering wrong changes to encounter logs
If there is a pattern of DKP abuse, an officer will approach the offender in question to discuss. Disciplinary action may be taken, ranging from log removal, to DKP docking, to guild removal.

### Special Considerations:

#### Idol camp:
* If a raid happens while you are at the idol camp, ask an officer or raid leader if they need you to log over to assist. If your help is not not needed at the raid, you can add yourself to that event.

#### Porter role:
* Individuals occupying the porter role cannot add themselves to raid logs. If a raid occurs, quickly finish porting, sign out, and attend the raid in question.

### General reminders
* In line with the guild vision (bring your best toon to the situation whenever possible), characters under level 60 (55 for mages where necessary, 52 for clerics) that aren't performing specialized roles for the encounter (FTE, goalkeeping, etc.) are not eligible to earn DKP or bid on items (excepting Lady Vox & Lord Nagafen).
* Please remember that this is an honor-based system. Any abuse of our system will not be tolerated.
* Don't claim DKP or add yourself to raids if you are AFK (example, you are the bind sight target in Kael and AFK)
* Do not track a target that is clearly not adding any value to the guild (e.g. overnight Nexona).
* Don't sit on trackers for lesser targets knowing we are locked into something else for an extended period. (e.g. don't track Nexona when we are locked into a Vulak`Aerr slog).
* If you are unsure about how to handle an individual situation, please ask an officer or raid leader!

## Spending DKP

### How to Spend
* You may bid any amount of your DKP (as shown on our DKP site or by Garanel Rucksif) for any item (considering the restrictions above) for any character.
  * Note: If you have acquired item(s) in the interim that haven't been taken into account by Garanel, it is on you to subtract the cost of that item from your DKP pool before bidding on additional items/
* Bidding is done in /gu at any increment.
* When bidding slows, bids should be closed with a countdown from 30 seconds, 15 seconds, 5 seconds, last call, and then announce the winning bid (including the bidder's name).
* Once the winning bid is announced in /gu, no more bids are allowed.
* Ties are not allowed. Bids have to be unique, so two or more persons cannot bid the same amount of DKP for the same item at the same time.
* In the case where there are multiples of an item being bid at once, the rule about ties still applies but all of the winners will pay the lowest bid (for example, if we have 3 items, and the top bids are 13, 12 and 10 -- all three winners will pay 10 DKP).

### Epic Quest Items
* You must have a level 46+ toon to bid on epic quest drops. For example, if you are bidding on Green Dragon Scales, you must have a rostered, tagged level 46 warrior.
  * Exception: Wizards are allowed to bid on Eye of Innoruuk

### Loot Rots
* We will do all we reasonably can to help you get an alt or toon to the corpse of something we killed, but it is ultimately your responsibility to loot it.
* Loot rots will be handled on a case-by-case basis, but in most circumstances you should expect to be charged the full amount of the item that rots.

### Shared Accounts
* Shared toons must be assigned to one "main" account. Only that person can bid on loot for that toon, even when multiple people play the toon on raids.
* Bidding for another person is only allowed in the event of an item rotting and the intent of the person to pay for that item has been made clear upfront to the guild & officers.

## Selling Raid Loot

### General Rule
* Fuse allows the selling of raid loot–you can bid DKP for droppable items with the intention of resale.

### Exceptions
* You may not sell loot rights for NODROP items (loot rights or multi-quest - i.e. you cannot bid for a Chestplate of Vindication with the intention to sell loot rights to another player)
* You may not sell epic quest-related items (Slime Blood of Cazic Thule, White & Green Dragon Scales, Shattered Emerald of Corruption, Eye of Innoruuk, etc.)
* You may not sell any of the following items:
  * Helmet of Rallos Zek
  * Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings
  * Boots of the Storm
  * Earring of the Frozen Skull
  * Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask
  * White Dragon Helm
  * Mithril Boots

## Losing DKP

### General Rule
* DKP docks are at officer discretion–if you behave poorly, fail to perform raid duties, defraud your guildmates (by inappropriately adding yourself to logs, bidding on items that dropped at a raid you didn't actually attend, etc) you may be docked. Officers will make a decision and inform you before the adjustment

### Boneform
* Do not cast Ignite Bones or Conglaciation of Bones (aka boneform) mobs unless specifically asked. This rule extends to both Neb's Warbone and Paebala Warbone.
  * Exceptions: a dracoliche, a soul carrier, an essence carrier, an essence tamer, a soul harvester, a soul tamer, an ashenbone drake (please boneform these)

## Fuse Tag / Participating in Guild Raids

### /anon and /roleplay
* We expect our members to show the Fuse tag with pride! Therefore we do not go /anon unless explicitly told to do so. There is no good reason to hide your guild tag. If a player is caught /anon, they will be warned by officers. If you want to hide your class/race/level between raids use /roleplay.
* Do not use /roleplay on raids unless you have a good reason to do so (e.g. tagging out of kites in Growth/Fear). Raid leaders need to be able to identify raid composition quickly and efficiently (healers, DPS, trainers, etc.)

### Non-tagged toons
* In order to ensure fluid communication and prevent confusion during a raid, we expect people to have their raid toons <Fuse> tagged. Participating in a raid on non or other-guilded toon must be cleared with an officer BEFORE joining the raid in order to be entitled to DKP or loot.

### AFK on Raids
* We expect our members to put up an AFK tag when they need to take a small break. If your break takes more than 5 minutes, please log out in a safe location! Staying AFK at raid for a longer period of time might jeopardize the raid's ability to progress (e. g. we have to move, vacate North ToV ASAP, and so on). Players with AFK tags will not be removed from logs.
* Attempts to game the system and AFK during a raid are typically noticed; patterns of abuse will be handled appropriately.

## Discord Auctions

* Droppable loot on quakes will typically be handled later via a Discord auction. This is to ensure the raid force isn't derailed by handling droppable loot in guild and/or voice.
  * Note: Droppables can be opened up for bid at any point via officer discretion.
* If you loot an item from a raid, please make a note of it either in /guild and/or FDKP Discord server under #loot-postings.
* Any item that has been looted for MQ/later auction will have a Discord channel created for the item within 24 hours in our RDKP Discord.
* Discord auctions will stay open for a minimum of 24 hours & end when the last bid was 18 hours prior.

## Batphone & Joker Phone targets

### Batphone
* Every target that rewards DKP must be batphoned.
* If a mob is set as a target in Gynok, DKP will be awarded for tracking.
* Setting a mob as "target" in Gynok is reserved to officers and raid leaders.

### Joker Phone
* Joker Phone is strictly for non-DKP targets. All members can issue a call-for-arms on non-raid targets.
* Loot rules for Joker Phone targets must be included in the Joker Phone.
* Tracking raid targets does not entitle you to roll on loot at Joker Phone events by default–it is up to the discretion of the event's organizer (ideally this should be included in the Joker Phone message).

Examples of Joker Phone targets:
* HoT pick 3
* Sleeper's Tomb clears
* Keldor Dek`Torek

## Tracking, Socking, FTE, Misc

### Regular Tracking:
* Pet / face / ranger tracking (a mob set as target): [6 DKP] (per hour)
  * This person will have a pet summoned and spam a /pet attack macro, stare a mob's spawn point, or sit on a ranger and use track when it's off of cooldown.
  * Exception(s): Dread, Essedera, Fright, Lepethida, Lord Yelinak, Terror, and Venril Sathir are [3 DKP/hr]

### Competitive Tracking

#### COTH mage [coth]: [6 DKP] per hour)
* This person is COTHing for the instant engagement of a mob (The Final Arbiter, Trakanon, The Statue of Rallos Zek, King Tormax, etc.). Special exceptions can be approved by officers–in certain circumstances, Lady Nevederia and Jorlleag can be instant engages and require a COTH mage.
* Exception(s): The Statue of Rallos Zek & King Tormax are [10 DKP/hr]
* The Final Arbiter, Trakanon, Velketor the Sorcerer are [3 DKP/hr]

#### FTE racer [fte]: [6 DKP] (per hour)
* This role applies to individuals racing to engage a mob and only applies to instant-engage scenarios.
* FTE racers will only be paid hourly DKP if they are on a toon that has a reasonable chance to win. For example, non-bow classes racing for MotG do not stand a reasonable chance of winning FTE. Non-bards racing for PoFear targets or Gorenaire do not stand a reasonable chance to win FTE (unless grouped with a bard). There are rare exceptions, but do not sign up for this role unless you are playing a class that has a chance to win.
* Exception(s): The Statue of Rallos Zek & King Tormax are [10 DKP/hr]
* Kelorek`Dar, Master of the Guard, and The Progenitor are [3 DKP/hr].

#### Engage team (typically linked to a COTH mage) [etxxx]: [5 DKP] (per hour)
* The engage team role applies to characters that are necessary at the point of engagement. All engagements require, at a minimum, a tank (or tanks) and clerics.
* There are rare circumstances where other classes may be eligible for an engage team (rare cases of bumpers and slowers), but, as a rule of thumb: if you are not on a warrior or a cleric, you can likely sign in when a Batphone goes out to no ill effect.
* For example, a rogue should never be part of a Lord Yelinak engage team but, on Trakanon, etrog is completely acceptable because we need rogues at Trakanon as quickly as possible.
* If you don't understand an individual encounter and whether or not you qualify for engage team status, reach out to an officer for clarification.
* For engages that require COTHs, engage teams are limited to the number of mage(s) x5–if there are two mages online, an engage team can have a maximum size of 10 players. If you are not in the first 5 COTHs, you can simply respond to a Batphone as you usually would.

General rules for engage team without officer approval (for approval, ping @Officers):
* First half of window: tracker only
* Second half of window: engage team with COTH mage
* Last quarter of window: full sock

#### Buffing engage/pull team [buff]: [3 DKP] (per hour)
* This applies to players that are actively buffing our racers/engage team members.

### Misc
* Trackers who find Magi P`Tasa up and Batphone him will receive a 15 DKP bonus.
* Trackers who find Plane of Hate minis (excluding: Magi P`Tasa (covered above), Corrupter of Life, High Priest M`kari, Maestro of Rancor) will receive a 5 DKP bonus.
* Idol Camp: [2 DKP] (per hour) + 2 DKP per idol farmed (post in #other-dkp-earned)
  * If a raid event happens while you're camping idols, you cannot add yourself to raid logs unless cleared by a raid leader.
  * You cannot add yourself to hourly logs when you are at idol camp (e.g. hourly DKP HoT, Plane of Growth, Plane of Sky).
  * You cannot add yourself to a buff session unless you have parked a fully-buffed toon.
  * Message !idol start to Gynok to start the hourly camp and !idol stop when done.
  * There will be a limit of three people allowed to sign in for this role–if Fuse controls the camp and there is no one in line behind them, then only one person should be signed in–we are not competing with ourselves for the idol camp!
  * If another entity (or entities) is in line after Fuse, two additional people can use this role (up to a total of three) to ensure that we keep several people in line to keep the idol farming going. For example, if Fuse is holding the camp and Gravity shows up (to be next in line), we would like to have an additional person behind them.
  * If Gravity (or another entity) only has one person in line after us, two people are authorized to use the !idol role (Fuse > Gravity > Fuse).
  * If Gravity (or another entity) has two people in line after us, three people are authorized to use the !idol role (Fuse > Gravity> Fuse > Gravity > Fuse).
  * Note: The guild bank will also buy idols for market value (if you find one for sale in EC).
* Logistics role [6 DKP] (per hour)
  * This role is reserved for helping with guild logistics.
* Porter role [4 DKP] (per hour)
  * Only one person may occupy the porter role at a time.
  * The porter must be bound at the Temple of Veeshan.
  * The porter role must be offered up after four hours.
  * The porter cannot be /roleplay.
  * People occupying the porter role cannot add themselves to logs for porting.

### Special Considerations
* If you are performing any of the above duties, you cannot double-dip DKP for any hourly event. You are welcome to take the higher of the two DKP values in any given scenario.

## Tracking Distribution

* In order to share tracking roles throughout the guild and discourage burnout, there is a soft time limit of 4 hours of continuous tracking, after 4 hours, the tracker must offer the position in guild chat and Discord (in the #tracking-replacements channel).
  * Note: We do not want people to end one tracking job after 4 hours and immediately pick up another tracking job to skirt the 4 hour rule–you are not fresh at this point. Take a break. Get some water. Touch grass. Do a stretch. If there is absolutely no one else willing to track, that's okay. Be reasonable or officers will ask you to take a longer break.
* The replacement will be first come, first served. If multiple tracking positions become available, try to replace the person who has tracked longest.
* If there is no replacement, you are free to remain on the tracker.

Note: The 4 hour rule does not apply to FTE or ET roles.

## Powerleveling Guild Bots

### Basics
* DKP will be awarded for XP earned–base value is 3 DKP per 1,000,000 XP points. Since we cannot measure exactly how much XP someone earns, we roughly estimate it based on the percentage of XP the toon had earned in a powerleveling session.
* Exact DKP value will be calculated by an officer using the Powerleveling DKP sheet.
* DKP can be divided between a maximum of 4 individuals. Anything more than 4 individuals, is considered an XP group. In cases of XP groups, 'only the person using the bot can claim DKP.
* Uneven DKP will be divided in favor of the first person mentioned in the message.
* Only officer-approved bots can be powerleveled for DKP! They will be mentioned in #announcements.
* There is a 500 DKP/month limit on powerleveling.

### Examples
* Solo bard AFK PL session in DN (XP gets shared between bard and PLed bot): Bard gets all the DKP (or can be shared, at the discretion of the PLing party)
* Enchanter groups up with a cleric bot and XPs that way: DKP will be shared between the enchanter and the person on the bot
* Bot is played in a regular XP group: person on the bot gets all the DKP

### How
Request DKP for your powerleveling efforts in #other-dkp-earned like so:
```
"Luddo PLed Warders from 32% to 42% in level 59"
"Franswa PLed Nulla level 1-48.78"
"Irisana and Franswa PLed Tertia from 50% in 58 to 48% in 59, split evenly"
```

| Scepter of the Forlorn | 10 DKP |
| Wand of Mana Tapping | 10 DKP |

* 50 DKP COTH FTE bonus for both the COTHer and the COTHee (Only applies to instant engage scenarios; if doubles/triples aren't instant engages, they are ineligible for this bonus. This most regularly applies to Zlandicar and Lord Yelinak)

### 30 DKP
* Vaniki
* 5 DKP pull team bonus

### 20 DKP
* Dread (non-CT spawns)
* Fright (non-CT spawns)
* Kelorek`Dar

* Velketor the Sorcerer (only applies to FTE-on-COTH scenarios, 20 DKP to COTH/COTHee)
* Terror (non-CT spawns)
* Trakanon
* 5 DKP pull team bonus (applies to kiters and DT takers–does not apply to Guardian Kozzalym)

### Caveats:
* FTE bonuses are only awarded in race-on-spawn scenarios–if we are not instantly engaging a mob (i.e. we have time to gather for Zlandicar or Hoshkar or Dain), no FTE bonuses will be awarded.
* FTE bonuses for COTH engages will be awarded to the winning mage/FTEr only.
* FTE bonuses are only awarded on contested targets. This means if our competitors are locked into other targets, no bonus will be awarded. If our competitors are not locked into other targets but not actively racing for the target in question, no FTE bonus is awarded.
* Always race for the most valuable mob you can feasibly race for. (e.g. when Gorenaire is in window, prioritize Gorenaire over Kelorek`Dar (lower DKP value) or ST golems (3 day spawns).
* FTE bonuses are only intended for non-earthquake spawns only (exception: King Tormax)
* DKP bonuses for the FTEr will be awarded even if we fail to kill the target, pull team is not eligible for bonuses if no-kill.
* FTE bonuses are only awarded on the initial race for FTE–picking up a dropped FTE is not the same as winning a FTE race.
* Pull team bonus only applies on contested, race-on-spawn scenarios. Only the racers that were signed up at the time of spawn are eligible for the pull team bonus.
