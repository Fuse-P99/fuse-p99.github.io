# Our Story

Fuse was born from the merger of two respected guilds on Project 1999: **Kittens Who Say Meow** and **Riot**. This historic union took place in March 2024, bringing together two communities with shared values and a common vision for the future.

## The Legacy Guilds

### Kittens Who Say Meow
Kittens Who Say Meow was a family-oriented casual guild that maintained an active raiding schedule while fostering a welcoming community. Despite their casual nature, they achieved remarkable success:
- Cleared all content in the game
- Maintained a family-friendly, supportive environment
- Balanced raiding with real-life commitments
- Built strong relationships between members
- Demonstrated that casual playstyle and raid success can coexist

### Riot
Riot was the premier raiding guild on Project 1999, known for their competitive spirit and consistent success:
- Top-tier raid guild competing for every raid target
- Years of experience in high-end raiding
- Efficient and effective raid strategies
- Strong leadership and organization
- Commitment to excellence in all aspects of gameplay

## The Merger

In March 2025, after months of discussions and planning, the leadership of both guilds came together to form Fuse. This merger was driven by:
- Shared values and goals
- Complementary strengths
- Desire to create a stronger, more unified community
- Vision for long-term guild sustainability
- Preparation for a possible server merger

## What Makes Fuse Unique

## Looking Forward
