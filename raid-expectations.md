# Raid Expectations

Fuse has no raid attendance requirement. If you do attend raids, strive to meet the following expectations:

## Communication
* Join voice chat and be responsive
* Read the room and keep communication clear, concise and relevant to the raid
* Anything that can be accomplished through in-game communication should be
* Raid-cycle-review is the outlet for raid feedback after completion of the raid

## Contribution
* Be present and focused
* If you need to AFK, use the AFK tag or log out
* Know the expectations of your class (reference table below)
* If you can't achieve those expectations, swap to a Rogue to backstab and evade on cooldown

## Preparation
* Be ready with essential raid items (worts, wands, idols, etc.) and stay recharged
* Be parked at the raid zone or able to mobilize quickly (CT, Thurg pots)
* Know the zone and encounter strategies

## Fuse First
* Make decisions that benefit the guild
* Prioritize the group's success
* Be proactive about swapping to necessary roles
* Fuse relies on the honor system. Don't betray the trust of your guildmates

## Have Fun & Be Respectful
* Remember, this is a game
* Stay positive, support your guildmates, and focus on improvement (prioritize advanced class roles)
* Don't fear failure
* Try new things and embrace death (you will get back 96% of lost experience)
